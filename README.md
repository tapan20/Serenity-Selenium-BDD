	* Install dependencies `mvn install`
	* You can set environment variables or update `serenity.properties` file with your [LambdaTest Username and Access Key](https://automation.lambdatest.com)

## Running your tests
- To run a single test, run `mvn verify -P single`
- To run parallel tests, run `mvn verify -P parallel`

Know how many concurrent sessions needed by using our [Concurrency Test Calculator](https://www.lambdatest.com/concurrency-calculator?ref=github)


## Notes

###  Routing traffic through your local machine
 - Set tunnel value to `true` in test capabilities
 > OS specific instructions to download and setup tunnel binary can be found at the following links.
 >    - [Windows](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Local+Testing+For+Windows)
 >    - [Mac](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Local+Testing+For+MacOS)
 >    - [Linux](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Local+Testing+For+Linux)

 ### Important Note:
 Some Safari & IE browsers, doesn't support automatic resolution of the URL string "localhost". Therefore if you test on URLs like "http://localhost/" or "http://localhost:8080" etc, you would get an error in these browsers. A possible solution is to use "localhost.lambdatest.com" or replace the string "localhost" with machine IP address. For example if you wanted to test "http://localhost/dashboard" or, and your machine IP is 192.168.2.6 you can instead test on "http://192.168.2.6/dashboard" or "http://localhost.lambdatest.com/dashboard".


## Notes
* You can view your test results on the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://www.automation.lambdatest.com)
* To test on a different set of browsers, check out our [Capabilities Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator)
